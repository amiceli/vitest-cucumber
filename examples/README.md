# Tests examples with vitest-cucumber

This example come from a Vue side project : 

- `gherkin-example.feature` is a Gherkin example using `Scenario` and `Scenario Outline`
- `vue-example.spec.ts` is a test file using `vitest-cucumber` 

You can't run it but you can see how to use `vitest-cucumber`.

## No dependency with a framework

`vitest-cucumber` need only `vitest`. 
This example is for vue using `@vue/test-utils` but you can use `vitest-cucumber` with another Framework like Angular, Svelte, etc.

## Asap

I will publish an example project where you will be able to run tests ;).
